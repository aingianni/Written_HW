## How does the internet work?
<p>
    The internet is a way to access hosted databases on a webpage that can then display the information for that database in HTML. Webpages can link to many other webpages and the data contained in a directory is access'ed in an organized manor due to formatting in HTML. There are different programming languages to make this work the main three being HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What does HTML do?
<p>
    HTML allows us to store all the of the information on a web page into elements and format the page. Without HTML there wouldnt be anything to show on the websites we visit. Tables, lists, headers, divs, these are all handled with HTML elements. We can place them and organize them withing the code to represent how we want to display the information on the web page.

## What does CSS do?
<p>
    CSS is a cascading style sheet. It is responsible for styling the elements on the web page. We can target specific HTML elements or all of a specific HTML element and change aspects of its styling. Font, color, size, decoration are all examples of what we can change in our CSS to stylize our page. We can also add animations to those elements using CSS. We can hide and display elements as well.

## What does JavaScript do?
<p>
    JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to run logical conditional statements to determine if or when something should happen. In the case of a web page this can be applied to buttons, elements, timed events, etc... We can use JS to listen for specific events using our logic to check and then change the web page based on those conditions. JS is what makes the web page more dynamic.
